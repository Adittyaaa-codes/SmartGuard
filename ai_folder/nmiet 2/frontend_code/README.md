- **Interactive Maps**: Drone positioning with patrol patterns
- **Chart Animations**: Dynamic charts using Chart.js

## File Structure

```
frontend_code/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css           # Complete CSS with military theme
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js            # Core JavaScript functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ drone-control.js   # Drone management system
â”œâ”€â”€ object-detection.js # AI object detection interface
â”œâ”€â”€ analytics.js       # Analytics and charting system
â”œâ”€â”€ placeholder-feed.jpg # Placeholder image (replace with actual feed)
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy Files**: Copy all files from this `frontend_code/` folder to your Django project's static files directory.

2. **Update Paths**: If needed, update the paths in `index.html` to match your Django static file configuration.

3. **Add Images**: Replace `placeholder-feed.jpg` with actual surveillance feed images.

4. **Django Integration**: Make sure your Django settings include proper static file serving.

## Dependencies

The frontend uses the following external libraries:
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: For responsive layout and components
- **Chart.js**: For analytics charts and visualizations
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: For icons and military-themed symbols

All dependencies are loaded via CDN for easy deployment.

## Customization

### Colors
The design uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming:
```css
:root {
    --military-dark: #0a0e14;
    --military-green: #1a3518;
    --military-highlight: #4a8;
    --military-accent: #8b0000;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Animations
- **Radar Scan**: Continuous rotating radar sweep
- **Matrix Rain**: Falling code effect background
- **Particle Float**: Ambient floating particles
- **Drone Pulse**: Animated drone indicators
- **Scan Lines**: Moving scan effects

### API Integration
The frontend expects the following API endpoints:
- `/api/system-metrics/` - System performance data
- `/api/drone-status/` - Drone fleet status
- `/api/alerts/` - Alert management
- `/api/detect-objects/` - Object detection processing
- `/api/analytics-data/` - Analytics and reporting

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance

- Optimized animations using CSS transforms
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Real-time updates with configurable intervals

## Security Features
